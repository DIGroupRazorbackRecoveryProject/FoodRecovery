  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Razorback Food Recovery! Our mission is to reduce food waste by connecting volunteers with event hosts who have leftover food for pickup. By working together, we help redistribute surplus food to those in need and reduce environmental impact.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We believe that no good food should go to waste. Through our app, we provide a streamlined platform for event hosts to post food pickup requests and for volunteers to find and fulfill those requests. Together, we are building a more sustainable community.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Event Hosts:</strong> Post food pickup requests after events, indicating the type and quantity of food available.</li>
      <li><strong>Volunteers:</strong> Browse available requests, select the ones they can fulfill, and help distribute the food where it's needed most.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Impact:</strong> By participating, you’re not only helping to reduce food waste but also supporting those in need within your community.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Join Us</h2>
  <p>If you’re passionate about making a difference, we invite you to join us as a volunteer or event host. Together, we can create a more sustainable and equitable world, one meal at a time.</p>
